Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. This document was produced using R Markdown.

When you click the **Knit** button in RStudio a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

In answering assignment questions,  incorporate mathematics, `R code`, and plots as appropriate.  

For example, using `RMarkdown` from `RStudio`, you might have something inline showing like this `qt(0.9, 64)` and evaluated like this `r qt(0.9, 64)`.  

You will also want to include whole chunks of code and output like this:

```{r}
n <- 40
x <- runif(n, min=-2, max=2)
y <- x^2 + rnorm(n, sd=0.2)
plot(x,y, pch=19, col= adjustcolor("firebrick", alpha.f=0.7))
```

And then have your discussion appear around the code and the plot it produced.  

Alternatively you might want to just show the code, without evaluating it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
n <- 40
x <- runif(n, min=-2, max=2)
y <- x^2 + rnorm(n, sd=0.2)
plot(x,y, pch=19, col= adjustcolor("firebrick", alpha.f=0.7))
```

Or evaluate it but not show it

```{r, echo=FALSE}
n <- 40
x <- runif(n, min=-2, max=2)
y <- x^2 + rnorm(n, sd=0.2)
plot(x,y, pch=19, col= adjustcolor("firebrick", alpha.f=0.7))
```

You might also want to be a bit particular about any figure you produce:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
n <- 40
x <- runif(n, min=-2, max=2)
y <- x^2 + rnorm(n, sd=0.2)
plot(x,y, pch=19, col= adjustcolor("firebrick", alpha.f=0.7))
```


**Some Math**

It might, or might not, include some mathematics inline like this $\mu({\bf x})$ or this $\frac{\pi}{2}$, using \$ around the texts or, using \$\$ as a separate block like this
$$
Y_{new} - \widetilde{\mu}({\bf x}_{new}) \sim N\left(0 ~,~ \sigma^2 \left( 1 + {\bf x}_{new}^T\left( {\bf X}^T{\bf X} \right)^{-1}
                      {\bf x}_{new} \right) \right).
$$
or even a multi-equation block like:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\alpha & = & Pr\left(-a ~\le~ 
\frac{ Y_{new} - \widetilde{\mu}({\bf x}_{new}) 
              }
     {\widetilde{\sigma} \sqrt{ 1 ~+~
      {\bf x}^T_{new}
             \left( {\bf X}^T{\bf X} \right)^{-1}
             {\bf x}_{new}
             }
     }
     \le ~a~ \right) \\
&& \\
&=& Pr \left(~ {\bf I}_{new}({\bf x}_{new})
            \ni Y_{new} 
        ~\right)
\end{array}
$$

You could also have used a different indicator for equations namely "\\[" and "\\]".

Here are a couple of other examples:
\[
x_i = 
\left\{  \begin{array}{lcl}
          1  & ~~~~~~ & \text{if } i \text{  is odd} \\
          &&\\
          0 & & \text{otherwise.}
          \end{array}
\right.
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{X} = 
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
a & b \\
&\\
c&d \\
&\\
3 & e 
\end{array}
\right]
\]
