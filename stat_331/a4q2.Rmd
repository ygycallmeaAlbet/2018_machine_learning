\subsection{Part a}
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
Y_{ijk}= \mu + \alpha_{i} + \lambda_{j} + 	\tau_{ij}+  R_{ijk}
\end{array}
$$
where mu is the over all mean  
alpha is the factor A  effect  
lambda is the factor b  effect  
tau is the interaction effect
R is the random Error  
where i is 1 to ta, ta = 2(# of A); j is 1 to tb, tb = 2(# of B); k is 1 to r, r = 4(# of blcok)  
constraints:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sum_{i = 1}^{ta}\alpha_{i} = 0,  \sum_{j = 1}^{tb}\lambda_{j}=0,\sum_{i}\tau_{ij} = 0,for& \forall i; \sum_{j}\tau_{ij} = 0, for& \forall j
\end{array}
$$

\subsection{Part d}
(i)     since the p-value 0.00179 < 0.05 (from part(c) code), there is STRONG evidence against H0.  
Whitch means there is no defference among treatments.

(ii)    since the p-value 0.5223 > 0.5, there is NO evidence against H0.
YES, interaction is significantly defferent from 0(code show below)
